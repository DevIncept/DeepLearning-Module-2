## Multi-layer Neural Networks #2

In this section, we would consider shallow neural networks alongside deep neural networks.

It has been a popular opinion that shallow neural networks are neural networks that are shallow (1 or 2 hidden layer) while deep neural networks are neural networks that are deep (more than two hidden layer). 

While this is true, I would love to opine that a shallow neural network is a network that doesnâ€™t just have one or two hidden layers, but a network whose number of layers are not sufficient for it to learn efficiently.

In similar manner, I would say deep neural networks are networks that are deep enough to efficiently learn, even though it may require many hidden layers or just a few.

So if a complex function would require 5 hidden neurons, but it is assigned only 2, it is a shallow neural network and vice versa.

Let's now look at some advantages of using multi-layer neural networks over single-layer neural network in the next section.
