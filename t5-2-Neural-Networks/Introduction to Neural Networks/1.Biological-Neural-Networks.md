# Biological Neural Network

Hello Everyone :wave:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Artificial Neural Network concept came from Biological Neural Network from our Brain. The brain is the most powerful computer in the world. 
So, first, discuss the Neuron present in our own body.

Our brain consists of millions of Neurons. The neuron is the basic working unit of the brain, a specialized cell designed to transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells.

Neurons generate electrical signals called *Nerve Impulse*, which allows them to quickly transmit information over long distances.
Almost all the neurons have three basic functions essential for the normal functioning of all the cells in the body.<br>
These are to:

1. Receive signals (or information) from outside.

2. Process the incoming signals and determine whether or not the information should be passed along.

3. Communicate signals to target cells, which might be other neurons or muscles or glands.

## Basic parts of Neuron
A Biological Neuron mainly composed of 3 main parts and an external part called a *synapse*.

### 1. Dendrite
Dendrites are responsible for getting incoming signals from outside.

### 2. Soma
Soma is the cell body responsible for the processing of input signals and deciding whether a neuron should fire an output signal.

### 3. Axon
Axon is responsible for getting processed signals from neurons to relevant cells.

### 4. Synapse
Synapse is the connection between an axon and other neuron dendrites.

## Working of the parts
The task of receiving the incoming information is done by dendrites, and processing generally takes place in the cell body. Incoming signals can be either ***excitatory*** (which means they tend to make the neuron fire or generate an electrical impulse) or ***inhibitory*** (which means that they tend to keep the neuron from firing). Axon helps in transmitting the signals.


In this blog, we see the basic structure of Biological Neural Network. In the next blog, we will see the Artificial Neural Network and how it related to Biological Neural Network.


:fire: ***Do you Know:*** :thinking: *Nerve Impulse* is also known as **Action Potential**.

Thank You :smile:
