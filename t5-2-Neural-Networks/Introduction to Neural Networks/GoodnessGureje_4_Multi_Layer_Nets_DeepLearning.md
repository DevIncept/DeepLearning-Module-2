## Multi-Layer Neural Networks #1

Hello and welcome to this section where we would consider Multi-layer Neural Networks :relaxed:. I am Goodness Gureje and I hope you find the information here much useful :muscle:.

In this first section, we would give an overview to ***how a multi-layer neural network works***.

As the name implies, a multi- layer neural network is a network that has multiple layers. 
In contrast to a single-layer neural network, after the first hidden layer has learned its parameters, it is then passed on to the next hidden layer(s) to learn further before the output is generated at the output layer. 

Hence, various stages of deep learning takes place as it passes from one layer to another. 

Multi-layer neural networks are best adaptable for non-linear and complex functions, such as computer vision, speech recognition, language processing and others. And this yields very wonderful results in the field of AI and Machine Learning.

Although, having many hidden neurons or layers in a deep neural network has the tendency of causing overfitting and high variance. 

However, multi-layer neural networks have better advantages than a single-layer neural network, as we would see in a subsequent section.

Moving on, we would consider shallow neural networks vs deep neural networks in the subsequent section.
