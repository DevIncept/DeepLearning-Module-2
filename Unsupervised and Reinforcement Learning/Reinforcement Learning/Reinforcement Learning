# Reinforcement Learning


a.what is reinforcement learning?

RL is an area of machine learning that deals with sequential decision-making, aimed at reaching a desired goal. An RL problem is constituted by a decision-maker called an Agent and the physical or virtual world in which the agent interacts, is known as the Environment. The agent interacts with the environment in the form of Action which results in an effect. As a result, the environment will feedback to the agent a new State and Reward. These two signals are the consequences of the action taken by the agent. In particular, the reward is a value indicating how good or bad the action was, and the state is the current representation of the agent and the environment. This cycle is shown in the following diagram:
